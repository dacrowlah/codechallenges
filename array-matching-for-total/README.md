The challenge was as follows:
===================================================
Here is a simple programming question. Try and answer it as efficiently as possible. The intent is not to trip you up or anything, merely to illustrate the technical requirements for this role. 

Specify the language you are using as part of the solution

Given two arguments, an int array (let's call it input) and another int (let's call it target), write a function that prints out all the pairs of input that sum up to target.

Example:
input = [ -1, -1, 4, 2, 1, 25, 0, 3, 2]
target = 3

desired print statements (ordering does not matter):
-1, 4
-1, 4
2, 1
0, 3
1, 2

Try and do it faster than O(n^2)

Bonus (for extra credit):
Instead of doing this as a function in memory. Input is now a text file that is handed to you and is too large to fit in memory. Same desired output.
